    Hello, I am a Post-Doctoral Researcher at <strong>Leiden University</strong> (Universiteit Leiden).
    I completed my Ph.D. in Political Science at <strong>Boston University</strong>, and previously worked
    as a post-doctoral researcher at <strong>McGill University</strong> and the
    <strong>University of Milan</strong> (Università degli Studi di Milano).
  </p>
  <p>
    My research examines how structural economic transformations—such as automation,
    globalization, and the green transition—shape public opinion, welfare states,
    and political behavior in advanced capitalist democracies. I combine survey and
    experimental methods, computer-assisted text analysis, and case studies to explore
    how economic and social risks influence citizens’ policy preferences and democratic attitudes.
  </p>

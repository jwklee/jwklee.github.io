      <h1>Teaching</h1>
      <p>
        My teaching philosophy emphasizes clarity, inclusivity, and <strong>learning by doing</strong>.
        I design courses that combine theoretical rigor with practical applications—such as data analysis,
        survey design, and policy writing—to help students connect abstract theories in political science
        and political economy to real-world challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Across all my courses, I aim to cultivate curiosity, analytical rigor, and an appreciation for
        complexity. I encourage students to see political and economic problems as interconnected and to
        develop the critical tools necessary to engage with them creatively and empirically.

  <!-- ===== Teaching Philosophy ===== -->
  <div class="teaching-section">
    <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      I view political science education as a process of <strong>guided discovery</strong>. My classrooms are
      interactive, inclusive, and discussion-driven, fostering an environment where students can engage with
      different perspectives and apply theoretical insights to empirical cases. I emphasize accessibility and
      clarity—translating complex ideas into structured, intuitive frameworks that allow students to build
      confidence in their analytical abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether in large introductory lectures or small seminars, I encourage students to think like
      researchers—to ask good questions, evaluate evidence, and communicate their ideas clearly. I believe
      that developing these skills not only deepens understanding of political and economic phenomena but
      also equips students for leadership in diverse professional and academic contexts.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- ===== Learning by Doing ===== -->
  <div class="teaching-section">
    <h2>Learning by Doing: Methods and Applications</h2>
    <p>
      I emphasize <strong>learning by doing</strong> through coding labs, simulations, and applied policy assignments
      that replicate real-world decision-making. These activities help students develop transferable skills in
      research design, quantitative analysis, and clear communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      My classes often include structured debates and role-playing exercises—simulating negotiations between
      labor unions, employers, and policymakers on issues such as welfare reform and environmental taxation—
      as well as digital simulations like <em>Statecraft</em>. In methods courses, students also learn data
      analysis using R and complete independent projects that foster computational literacy and critical
      engagement with empirical evidence.
    </p>

  <!-- ===== Courses and Pedagogical Approach ===== -->
  <div class="teaching-section">
    <h2>Courses and Pedagogical Approach</h2>
    <p>
      My teaching portfolio spans comparative politics, political economy, and quantitative methods. I have
      taught and co-taught a range of courses across institutions in North America, Europe, and East Asia. My teaching emphasizes active learning, clear communication,
      and interdisciplinary thinking that bridges politics, economics, and policy.
    </p>
    <ul class="courses-list">
      <li>Comparative Political Economy</li>
      <li>International Political Economy</li>
      <li>Comparative Public Policy</li>
      <li>Political Economy of Economic Transformations: Migration, Technology, and Climate Change</li>
      <li>Research Methods: Thinking Like a Political Scientist</li>

      “I really enjoyed how Jae tied the topics we learned in lecture to modern day events and broke down the exact definitions and significance of topics to fit into the overarching theme of comparative politics.”<br><br>
      “Jae was great, best political science TA I have had so far.”

    <h1>Teaching</h1>
    <p>
      I have two main objectives for students’ learning experiences: to provide fundamental knowledge and critical thinking tools applicable to students’ future careers in various academic and non-academic fields; to facilitate the appreciation for complex, big-picture issues inherent in processes of politics. My approach actualizes these objectives by creating a dedicated and engaged learning environment where I actively facilitate my students’ learning and engagement with politics. Through the courses, I expect students to enhance critical self-awareness and understanding of politics that impact individuals and the world.
